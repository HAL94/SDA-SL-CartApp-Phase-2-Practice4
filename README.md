# SDA-SL-CartApp-Phase-2-Practice4
A simple cart app that lists your products in the cart

This is a work in part of Simplilearn's and Saudi Digital Academy Course: .NET Fullstack Developer Track.

The main objective is a simple cart application using TypeScript that will perform basic CRUD operations of a cart.

# About the Data Source
The app is basically an NodeJS/Express server written with TypeScript, the data are stored in a JSON file to make things simple and portable for anyone to run the app.
Each time the app refreshes it will reload to a default state and start again.

# How To Run
I believe it would be preferable to run this without transpiling TypeScript to JavaScript. In ```package.json```, there is a script that will run the app in TypeScript, simply run:

```npm run dev```
